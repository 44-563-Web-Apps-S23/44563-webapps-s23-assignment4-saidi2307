        <h3>THE BOOR by ANTON TCHEKOV </h3>
        <p><h5 class="LUKA">LUKA.</h5> <p class="speech">It isn't right, ma'am. You're wearing yourself out! The maid and
            the cook have gone looking for berries; everything that breathes is
            enjoying life</p> </p><br>
        <p><h5 class="MRSPOPOV">MRS. POPOV.</h5> <p class="direction">[_Excitedly._]</p> <p class="speech MRS.POPOV">And I shall never leave it--why should I? My life is over.
            He lies in his grave, and I have buried myself within these four walls. We are both dead.</p></p>
            <br>
        <p><h5 class="LUKA">LUKA.</h5> <p class="speech">What is the use of all these words, when you'd so much rather go
            walking in the garden or order Tobby or Welikan harnessed to the trap,
            and visit the neighbors?</p></p>
        <p><h5 class="MRSPOPOV">MRS. POPOV.</h5><p class="direction"> [_Weeping._]</p><p class="speech">Oh!</p> </p>
        <p><h5 class="LUKA">LUKA.</h5><p class="speech">Madam, dear madam, what is it? In Heaven's name!</p></p>
        <p><h5 class="MRSPOPOV">MRS. POPOV.</h5><p class="speech"> He loved Tobby so! He always drove him to the Kortschagins
            or the Vlassovs. What a wonderful horse-man he was! How fine he looked
            when he pulled at the reins with all his might! Tobby, Tobby--give him
            an extra measure of oats to-day!
            </p></p>
        <p><h5 class="LUKA">LUKA.</h5><p class="speech"> Yes, ma'am.</p></p>
